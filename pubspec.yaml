  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SF-Pro-Tex
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Black.otf
          weight: 900
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Heavy.otf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Semibold.otf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Regular.otf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Thin.otf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/SF-Pro-Text-Ultralight.otf
          weight: 100
